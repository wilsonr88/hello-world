my_name = "Jordan"

# Please write your code below this line...
  def upper(string)
      string.upcase
  end
  

# ...and above this line.

puts "My name is #{upper(my_name)}"

 
//Write a method called upper that will output Jordan all in upper case. 

Note that we're passing the variable my_name as argument when weâ€™re calling the method, that should give you a hint on what you need to include. Please don't change any of our code, you can only write new code or reuse previous code.

Your output should read as below : 

My name is JORDAN

Your method should be a template - this can then be used for any variables that are passed through it. Have a look at one of our posts about how to think like a programmer here : http://bit.ly/think-like-a-programmer

By writing good, clean code - the same method should answer both questions in one and pass this section.//
