  def upper(string)
    string.upcase

    string.downcase

# Please write your code between this line...
  
# ... and above this line

puts "My name is #{lower(my_name)}"


//Now to create your next method. We've learnt how to make something all upper case. We now want to write out a method that will output Jordan in all lower case. Again, our new method needs to be scalable, so should return any name that's passed through to lower. It just so happens that the name in question here is Jordan.

//Your output should read as below:

//My name is jordan
