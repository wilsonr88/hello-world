//This is it! The final challenge. We're going to take everything we've learnt so far to write some really nice bit of clean code between lines 19 and 21.

//We want to return either:

//'My name is OLLIE'

 //or 

//'My name is ollie' 

//or 

//"My name is ANA" 

//or 

//"My name is ana"

 //to the console, AT RANDOM!
