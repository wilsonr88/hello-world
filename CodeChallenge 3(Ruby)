# Please write your code between this line...

# ...and between this line

puts "My name is #{random_name()}"


//Same as before, please don't edit or amend any of the code we've provided.

//Now you're moving on to randomisation. We'd like you to return one of two names at random through a method. 

//So your output from a method called random_name should either be:

//"My name is Ana" 

//or 

//"My name is Ollie"

//Think about the problem before writing any code. How you would structure your answer? What Ruby syntax would solve the problem and what would look the best?
