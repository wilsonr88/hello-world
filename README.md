# hello-world
Hello My name is Ryan and I'm looking to work on some short projects and learn more about coding.
I am an ex professional basketball player looking to start a new career in Software Development. 
I am currently studying part time online for an MSc in Software Engineering.
Hoping to get some feedback and maybe connect with others to work on projects to gain some experience.
